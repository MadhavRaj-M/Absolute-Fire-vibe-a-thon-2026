You are an expert Full-Stack Developer and UI/UX Designer competing in a hackathon. You need to build a "Grand Finale" prototype for an AI-Powered Emergency Response System called "PulsePath" in a **single HTML file**.

**Context:**
Based on the *Vibe-a-Thon 2026* problem statement, I need a solution that bridges the gap between a **Public Reporting App** and a **Command Center Dashboard**.

**Technical Requirements:**

* **Single File:** All HTML, CSS (Tailwind via CDN), and JavaScript must be in one file.
* **Libraries:** Use Leaflet.js for maps, Lucide for icons, and OSRM API for routing.
* **Theme:** "Cyberpunk/High-Tech" aesthetic. Dark mode (`#050505`), glassmorphism panels, neon accents (Blue for Medical, Red for Fire), and `JetBrains Mono` font.

**Feature Request 1: The Public User Interface (View A)**

* Create a clean, centered glass-panel form.
* **Inputs:** Text description (e.g., "Fire at Anna Nagar"), Media Upload (simulation), and a Location Dropdown (Anna Nagar, Guindy, Central, T Nagar).
* **AI Simulation:** When the user clicks "Submit", show a loading animation that simulates AI processing steps (e.g., "Analyzing keywords...", "Detecting Severity...", "Classifying: FIRE").
* **Status Tracker:** After processing, show a live vertical timeline tracking the response: *Report Received*  *Dispatching*  *En Route (with ETA)*  *Arrived*.

**Feature Request 2: The Command Center Map (View B)**

* **Map Layer:** Use a Satellite view (Esri World Imagery) covered by a faint "scanline" overlay for a tech feel.
* **Static Assets:**
* **Hospitals:** Mark 5+ real Chennai hospitals (Stanley, Apollo, Rajiv Gandhi, etc.) with blue markers.
* **Fire Stations:** Mark 3 real stations (Guindy, Anna Nagar, Ambattur) with red markers.
* **Fleet:** Spawn ambulances at hospitals and fire trucks at stations.


* **Traffic Signals:** Place "Smart Signals" at major intersections. These should visually turn from Red to Green when an emergency vehicle approaches.

**Feature Request 3: The Logic & Interaction (The "Magic")**

* **The Workflow:**
1. User submits a report (e.g., "Fire").
2. The app simulates AI classification (Type: FIRE, Severity: CRITICAL).
3. The view automatically switches to the **Command Map**.
4. An incident marker spawns at the selected location (e.g., Anna Nagar).
5. **Smart Dispatch:** The system calculates distances and dispatches the **nearest** appropriate unit (Fire Truck for Fire, Ambulance for Medical).
6. **Routing:** Use the OSRM API to fetch real road geometry. The vehicle must drive along the road path.
7. **Synchronization:** As the vehicle moves on the map, update the "ETA" and "Status" on the User View in real-time.



**Specific Details:**

* Ensure ambulances go to the incident, pickup, and then drive to the nearest hospital.
* Ensure fire trucks go to the incident and stay there.
* Add a "Reset System" button to restart the simulation.

**Goal:**
Generate the complete, error-free `index.html` code that implements this entire flow seamles


improve it by making it more like practically workable app with improved ui of live travel of emergency services to the incident area and the red signal along the path should turn to green when the emergency services pass through




make it so that  all of the areas are present and and emergency service to send is chosen by the ai rather then the user

the vehicles are not moving
